# firefox-omni-no-oneoffs
Disables search engines buttons (aka one offs) from Firefox urlbar (aka omnibar).

**How to**: replace file omni.ja in \Mozilla Firefox\browser folder with this copy.

upd1: This fix started to cause troubles with urlbar in version 85. 

upd2: Fixed it for version 91!

upd3: They broke it some time ago. It now breaks the browser! I'm looking into it.

upd4: Fixed it for **version 102**!
